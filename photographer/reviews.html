      I needed a photographer to take shots of the local Wacky Wavy Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man Emporium for the ad I was taking out in the newspaper,

      I'll never hire them again, they give me cancer, infected my appendix, ripped me off, stole my girlfriend. Oh, you mean the photography guys? Yeah, they're good I guess
